1. In the Chomsky hierarchy, what is the relation between type-n languages and type-
(n-1) languages?
2. If a language can be generated by a type-1 grammar, can the same language be
generated also by a type-2 grammar? Explain why.
3. How can we prove that the language $L=\Sigma+$ is regular?
4. Explain why type-1 grammars are also called monotonic grammars.
5. According to the given definitions, can a type-n grammar with n>0 generate a
language that includes the empty string e?
6. Is it possible to introduce further restrictions on regular grammars? What happens if
we do it?

---

1. Type n-1 grammars describe a larger set of languages, which have less restrictions than type n grammar, but they are also more complex.
2. It could, because type 2 grammar is a subset of type 1 grammar and describe more specific languages
3. Define a start simbol $s$ so that s -> aS | bS | a | b. This is a right regular grammar which generates every string with the alphabet a,b
4. Because the right side of a rule cant be smaller than the left side
5. No, because they are monotonic grammars and the empty string cant be generated
6. The non terminal character can be removed from the left side, then we have a grammar that can generate a singol symbol
