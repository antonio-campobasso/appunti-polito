# Regular languages
Regular sets are another way of **representing** a regular language without referring to the concept of grammar.

**Regular sets** over an alphabet:
- $\emptyset$.
- The set $\{\epsilon\}$ containing the **empty string**.
- The set $\{a\}$ containing any **symbol** of the alphabet.

If P and Q are regular sets over an alphabet, the same is true for:
- The **union** $P \cup Q$
- The **concatenatuon** $P Q = {xy \mid x \in P; y \in Q}$
- The **closures** $P^*$ and $Q^*$

**Regular expressions** represent **regular sets**.

**Regular expressions** of an alphabet:
- the expression $\phi$, denoting the empty set $\emptyset$.
- the expression $\epsilon$, denoting the set containing the empty string $\{\epsilon\}$.
- the expression a, denoting the set containing any symbol of the alphabet $\{a\}$.

if p and q are regular expression over an alphabet, the same is true for:
- the expression p | q, denoting $P \cup Q$.
- the expression p q, denoting the set $P Q$.
- the expression p* and q*, denoting the set $P^*$ and $Q^*$.


**Algebraic** properties are defined for regular expression

## Equations of regular expressions
- If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are regular expressions, $X = \alpha X \mid \beta$ is an equation with unknown $X$.
	- $X = \alpha^* \beta$ is a solution of the equation.
- A set of equations with unknowns $\{X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\}$ is composed by **n** equations such as:
$$X_i = \alpha_{i0} \mid \alpha_{i1} X_1 \mid \alpha_{i2} X_2 \mid ... \mid \alpha_{in} X_n$$
- Where each $a_{ij}$ is a **regular expression** over any alphabet *without unknowns*.

### Solutions of sets of equations
- Loop forward over all the equations
	- Put the equation **i** in the form $X_i = \alpha X_i | \beta$
	- Substitute $X_i$ with $\alpha^*\beta$ in equations i+1, i+2, ..., n
- Loop backwards over all the equations
	- The i-th equation is in the form $X_i = \alpha * \beta$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ do not contain unknowns.
	- Solve the i-th equation: $X_i = \alpha^* \beta$
	- Substitute $X_i$ with $\alpha^*\beta$ in equations i-1, i+2, ..., 1
