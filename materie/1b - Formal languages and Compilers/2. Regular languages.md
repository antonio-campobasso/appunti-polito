# Regular languages
Regular sets are another way of **representing** a regular language without referring to the concept of grammar.

**Regular sets** over an alphabet:
- $\emptyset$.
- The set $\{\epsilon\}$ containing the **empty string**.
- The set $\{a\}$ containing any **symbol** of the alphabet.

If P and Q are regular sets over an alphabet, the same is true for:
- The **union** $P \cup Q$
- The **concatenatuon** $P Q = {xy \mid x \in P; y \in Q}$
- The **closures** $P^*$ and $Q^*$

**Regular expressions** represent **regular sets**.

**Regular expressions** of an alphabet:
- the expression $\phi$, denoting the empty set $\emptyset$.
- the expression $\epsilon$, denoting the set containing the empty string $\{\epsilon\}$.
- the expression a, denoting the set containing any symbol of the alphabet $\{a\}$.

if p and q are regular expression over an alphabet, the same is true for:
- the expression p | q, denoting $P \cup Q$.
- the expression p q, denoting the set $P Q$.
- the expression p* and q*, denoting the set $P^*$ and $Q^*$.


**Algebraic** properties are defined for regular expression

## Equations of regular expressions
- If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are regular expressions, $X = \alpha X \mid \beta$ is an equation with unknown $X$.
	- $X = \alpha^* \beta$ is a solution of the equation.
- A set of equations with unknowns $\{X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\}$ is composed by **n** equations such as:
$$X_i = \alpha_{i0} \mid \alpha_{i1} X_1 \mid \alpha_{i2} X_2 \mid ... \mid \alpha_{in} X_n$$
- Where each $a_{ij}$ is a **regular expression** over any alphabet *without unknowns*.

### Solutions of sets of equations
- Loop forward over all the equations
	- Put the equation **i** in the form $X_i = \alpha X_i | \beta$
	- Substitute $X_i$ with $\alpha^*\beta$ in equations i+1, i+2, ..., n
- Loop backwards over all the equations
	- The i-th equation is in the form $X_i = \alpha * \beta$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ do not contain unknowns.
	- Solve the i-th equation: $X_i = \alpha^* \beta$
	- Substitute $X_i$ with $\alpha^*\beta$ in equations i-1, i+2, ..., 1

### Regular sets and linear languages
#TODO formule
#### Right-linear languages subset of regular sets


#### Regular sets subset of right-linear languages
The regular sets can be generated by right-linear grammars

- Consider 2 right-linear grammars with distinct non-terminal sets
- The language created by the union of the languages created by the grammars is also right-linear
	- his non terminal set is made of the union of the non terminal sets plus a new symbol which is the start symbol of the new grammar
	- new rule, the new start symbol can generate either the start symbols of the original grammars
- the language created by the concatenation of the languages created by the grammar is also right-linear
	- his non terminal set is the union of the non terminal sets
	- The start symbol is the start symbol of the first grammar
	- The rules is made of the union of the rules of the second grammar and a new set of rules #TODO vedi slides
- the language created by the closure of the language created by the grammar is right-linear

#### Additional proofs
right-linear = regular sets
left-linar = regular sets
right-linear = left-linear

## Deterministic finite automata (DFA)
- 5-tuple $A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$
	- $Q$ = finite (not empty) set of **states**.
	- $\Sigma$ = alphabet of **input** symbols.
	- $\delta$ = **transition** function.
		- $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$
	- $q_0$ = **start** state.
		- $q_0 in Q$
	- $F$ = set of **final states**.
		- $F \subseteq Q$

- **Transition table**
	- Tabular rapresentation of the transition function.
- **Transition diagram**
	- A graph where:
		- For each state in the automaton there is a node
		- For each transition there is an arc
		- the start state has an entering non labeled arc.
		- the final state is marked by a double circle.

### The language accepted by a DFA
- The domain of function $\delta$ can be extended from $Q \times \Sigma$ to $Q \times \Sigma^*$:
	- $\delta(q, \epsilon) = q$
	- $\delta(q, aw) = \delta(\delta(q,a),w)$ where $a \in \Sigma; w \in \Sigma^*$.
- Language accepted by the automaton:
$$L(A) = \{ W \mid w \in \Sigma^* ; \delta(q_0, w) \in F \}$$
