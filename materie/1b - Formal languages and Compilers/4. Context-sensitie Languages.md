#  Turing Machines
- A **TM** is a 6-tuple $P=(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, F)$ 
	- $Q$ = finite (non empty) set of **states**. 
	- $\Sigma$ = alphabet of **input** symbols. $(B \notin \Sigma)$
	- $\Gamma$ = alphabet of **tape** symbols. $(B \in \Sigma; \Sigma \subset \Gamma)$
		- The tape extends infinitely to the left and the right.
		- The tape initially holds the input string, preceeded and followed by an infinite number of $B$ symbols.
	- $\delta$ = **transition** function.
		- $\delta = Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L,R\}$. ($L$ = left, $R$ = right)
	- $q_0$ = **start** state $(q_0 \in Q)$.
	- $Z_0$ = **start stack symbol** $(Z_0 \in \Gamma)$.
	- $F$ = set of **final states** $(F \subseteq Q)$.

##  Transitions
- $\delta(q,X) = (p, Y, L)$
- $\delta(q,X) = (p, Y, R)$

- From state $q$, having $X$ as the current tape symbol:
	- Goes to state $p$ and replaces $X$ with $Y$.
	- Moves the tape head one position left or right.

## Languages accepted
Languages accepted by Turing machines are enumerable sets, equivalent to type 0 languages.

**Problems**
- A TM always halts when in accepting state
	- Not always possible to require that TM halts when it does not accept
- Membership of a string in recursively enumerable set is undecidable

- Languages accepted by TM that always halt are called recursive sets
- membershio of a string in recursive set is decidable


## Computability
church-turing thesis
- any computable function can be computed by TM

TM can be used to classify languages/problems/functions
