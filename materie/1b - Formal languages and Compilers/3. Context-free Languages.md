# Parse trees
- Defined as a tree $G = (N, T, P, S)$ where:
	- The **root** is labeled by the start symbol $S$.
	- Each interior **node** is labeled by a symbol in $N$.
	- Each **leaf** is labeled by a symbol in $N \cup T \cup \{ \epsilon \}$.
	- An interior node labeled by $A$ has children (from left to right) labeled by $X_1, X_2, ..., X_k$ only if $A \rightarrow X_1, X_2, ..., X_k$ is a production in $P$.
- A **yield** of a parse tree is a string obtained by concatenating (from left to right) the labels of the leaves.
