# Definizioni
- **Organizzazione** = gruppo di persone organizzate per raggiungere un obbiettivo. Può essere *pubblica* o *privata*.
- **Buisness Process** = insieme di attività parallele o sequenziali effettuate da un'organizzazione per consegnare un *prodotto/servizio* con input/output definiti.
- **Buisness Function** = grupp od ipersone e altre risorse in un'organizzazione che eseguono le stesse attività. Si distinguono 5 categorie principali
	- **Manufacturing**
	- **Sales**
	- **Finance**
	- **Accounting**
	- **Human Resources**
- **Buisness Application** = software che supporta un'attività
	- Spesso ce ne sono più di uno (**Buisness Portfolio**).
- **Information System** = system to store and process information used by organizations.
	- **Computer Based Information System** = subset of and information system.
	- **Digitalization** = all information is digital, CBIS == IS.
- **Integration** = many applications can read/write on one database.
- **View/Dimension** = area of interest.
	- It is better to handle complexity by considering several *orthogonal views*.
	- ex. Organizational, Data, Process, Buisness Rules, Tech (IT).


## IT Dimension
We can define 2 main models inside this dimension.
- **Application model (software)**
	- *Presentation layer* = interaction with end user via GUI.
	- *Buisness rules layer* = algorithms and rules to process, control and extract data.
	- *Data layer* = permanent storage of data according to a schema (oracle, mySQL, Access).
- **Technological model (hardware)**
	- *Processing architecture* = client/server model.
	- *Network architecture* = lan, man, wan.

# High level models
## Control loop model
An organization is capable of getting feedback from the his output, so the input can be improved before getting processed.
![[schema me 29_09 - 15_29.excalidraw]]

**Regulatory agencies** = Rules coming from outside to wich the organization must abide.
**Stakeholders** = Owner/partner who has intrest in the organization.

## CRASO model
![[schema me 29_09 - 15_36.excalidraw]]
- **C**ustomer
- **R**equest
- **A**ctivity
- organi**S**ation
- **O**utput

The processes (activities) can be implemented by one or more organizations:
	- **Mono-organizational** (only one)
		- Mono-functional (only one kind of service)
		- Inter-functional (different kind of services)
	- **Inter-organizational** (different)

## Anthony's model (Pyramid)
The pyramid indicates the number of people involved in a certain area
![[schema me 29_09 - 15_43.excalidraw]]
- **Strategic level** = decisions that impact the future of the organization(long term future).
- **Management level** = controlling the lower levels, confronting past values and future values and solving problems(mixed time view).
- **Knowledge level** = design of the product/service provided by the organization(usually a separate unit).
- **Operational level** = daily activities and operations of the organization.

### Sales and marketing
- **Sales** includes activities like contacting customers, selling products and taking order.

- **Marketing** is related to identifying customers, determining their real needs, advertising and promoting products and services.

- Strategic -> Prepare multi-year sales forecast
- Management -> Determine price for product or service
- Knowledge -> Market analysis
- Operational -> Selling products, Order processing

### Manufacturing
It involves operations like planning, development, establishment of productions goals, acquisition and storage of production materials, scheduling equipment, materials and facilities, integrate and control the production flow.

- Strategic -> Facilities location
- Management -> Production planning
- Knowledge -> Computer-aided design
- Operational -> Machine control

### Finance and Accounting
- **Finance** means managing the financial assets in order to maximize the return.

- **Accounting** concerns maintaining and managing the firm’s financial record and receipts to account the flow of funds in a firm.
	- **Sectional** (towards customers and suppliers, accounts payable/recievable)
	- **Institutional** (towards stakeholders and law, balance sheet, public communications)
	- **Management** (towards internal structure)

- Strategic -> Profit planning
- Management -> Budgeting
- Knowledge -> Portfolio analysis
- Operational -> Account recievable

### Human resources
Attracting, developing and maintaining workforce. The support system should support identifying potential employees, maintaining the complete record of them, creating program to develop employee skills.

- Strategic -> HR planning, long term labor needs
- Management -> Compensation analysis monitoring wages and benefit
- Knowledge -> Design career path
- Operational -> Training and development

## T-Model
![[schemi/1. High-Level Models_Th 10_02 - 14_47.excalidraw.md]]

 -  **Management**: strategic planning, control and business intelligence. The goal is to lead the organization.
	 - Strategic planning
 
• **Primary**: production and provisioning of products and services. The goal is to serve the customers. Defined by each sector (**Buisness Domain**)

- **Support**: accounting, resources management and business support. The goal is to provide services to the organization and comply with law obligations.
	- Administration
	- Human Resources
	- **Information Systems**
	- Other

### Buisness Domain - Manufacturing
Designing and producing individual items in large quantity.

Value chain model:
- Company implements a sequence of processes to deliver product/service
- Value of a product is how much a customer is willing to pay for it
- **Primary activities**
	- Inbound Logistics
	- Operations
	- Outbound Logistics
	- Marketing & Sales
	- Service
- **Phases**
	- Product/Process Design
	- Supply
	- Manifacture
	- Distribute
- **Process types:**
	- Planning
	- Execution
- PLM = Product Lifecycle Management
- BOM = Bills of Materials
	- For each product list parts
- Production cycle
	- For each product list of manufacturing/assembly operations

SCOR (Supply Chain Operation Reference):
- Main processes
	- Plan
	- Execute
	- Enable
- 3 levels
	- Top level
	- Configuration level
	- Process element

### Buisness Domain - Production Industries
- Production and Maintenance of plant

### Buisness Domain - Telecom operators
Main operations are:
- Planning and design of the network
- Activation and delivery of the service
- Train workforce for repairs, manage technical side

Marketing and sales is most important.

### Buisness Domain - Utilities
Suppliers of gas, electricity. Almost no competition.

### Buisness Domain - Bank and Insurance
Keeping databases, servers running, accounting is key.

### Buisness Domain - Retail
