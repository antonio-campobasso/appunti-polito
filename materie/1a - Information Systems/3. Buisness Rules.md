# Buisness Rules
A buisness rule is a statement that constrains some aspect of the buisness.
- Can only be **true** or **false**.
- Can apply to people, processes, IS.

If a buisness rule is encoded in computer language it is called **buisness logic**.

A set of buisness rules is called **buisness policy** and all the rules should be:
- **Declarative**
- **Precise**
- **Atomic**
- **Consistent**
- **Expressible**
- **Distinct**
- **Buisness-oriented**

## Drools rule language
- Person() = matches all Person objects in the working memory
- Person(age == 100) = matches all Person objects having age = 100
	- Any math expression can be inserted in the parenthesis

### Building variables
``` drools
rule ...
when
	$p = Person( $address : address)	# assign $addres variable to address value of person
	$p2 = Person( address == $address) 	# finds 2 people with the same address
then
	system.out.println("Person" + $p + $p2)
end
```

"accumulate" iterates a rule over a collection of objects.
``` drools
rule ...
when
	$order = Order()
	$total = Number(doubleValue > 100)
			from accumulate(OrderItem(order == $order, $value = value), sum($value))
then
	# apply discount to $order
end
```
