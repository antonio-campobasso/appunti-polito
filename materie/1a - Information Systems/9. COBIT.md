## Processes
- Governance
- Management
	- Plan

For each practice a RACI chart
- R = Responsible (the person(s) who does the work, R reports to A, A approves the work)
- A = Accountable (the person who is accountable for the completion of the task)
- C = Consulted (people who provide information, 2-way comunication)
- I = Informed (people kept informed of progress, 1-way comunication)


## Principles
1. Meeting stakeholder needs
