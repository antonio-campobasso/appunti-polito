# Technology
## deployment diagram
**Node** = physical entity or software entity capable of processing (Can be nested).

**Artifact** = source file, executable file, library, db table (Can be nested). 

**Association** = line, meaning *deployed on*

## Data flow diagram
Process = recives and transforms data
Data flow = Stream of data
Data store = Stores data

## Consistency between models
- **Organizational vs BPMN**
	- In *BMPN* pools and lanes replicate parts of the organizational model.
- **BPMN vs data model**
	- In BPMN data artifacts must match with classes in data model.
- **Data model vs data flow model**
	- Data flows or data stores in data flow model must match classes/attributes in data model.
- **BPMN vs deployment diagrams**
	- Artifacts in deployment diagram must contain software functions used in BPMN activities.
