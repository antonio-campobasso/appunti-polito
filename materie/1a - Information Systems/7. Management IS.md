# Management cycle
![[schemi/7. Management IS_Tu 04_01 - 14_36.excalidraw.md]]

Management and Strategic level IS should support managers in
- monitoring and controlling the organization
- using few, reliable indicators

## Indicators and measures
- Indicators
	- High level
- Measures
	- Detailed, possibly objective and repeatable
- One indicator -> Many measures

ex. entity = person, indicator = age, measure = year of last birthday

### Measure
- Attribute of an entity
- Typical entities in organization
	- Resource
	- Activity
	- Procuct / Service

## Accounting
- Focuses on cost, revenues, cash flow etc
- Financial accounting
	- Historical perspective
- Management accounting
	- Private, sensible data
	- Budget and cactual cost of operations
	- Analysis of variances and profitability

- Direct costs = directly traceable to a product / service sold to a customer
- Indirect costs = all others

- Fixed costs = do not depend on number of units produced
- Variable costs = depend on number of units produced

**How to allocate costs?**
- Proportional to number of elements manufactured
- Activity based costing
	- Technique in management accounting
	- Developed to overcome problems in proportional
	- Requires to collect precisely how costs are split


**FTE** = Full time equivalent
- Virtual number of employees working full time on a process
- ex. 10 employees working 30% on process A -> 3 FTE working on process A

## Critical Success Factor (CSF)
- Indicator
- Refers to internal areas, not objectives or targets
- Exists at different levels, following organization structure
	- Corporation
	- Function
	- Role

### CSF types
- From buisness domain
	- Key areas for all comanies in the same buisness domain
- From competitive factors within buisness domain
	- Factors that differentiate company from others
- From enviromental factors
	- Constraints from outside such as norms, rules, standards
- From contingency factors
	- Temporary contraints

### CSF descriptor
- Name

- Process perspective
- Process view
	- Involves one or more heirarchical nodes
	- Financial and non financial indicators
- Should be defined for each stakeholder
### KPI descriptor
- Name
	- Average delay to satisfy order
	- Average productivity of resource
- Definition
	- How the KPI is computed
	- Measurement unit
- Type
- Segmentation

### KPI framework
#### General
- Input volume
- Output volume
- Human resources
- Non human resources (plants, machines, facilities)
- Inventory
- Other resources

#### Efficiency
- Cost per unit
	- Low if productivity is high or utilization is high
- Productivity of resources
	- Volume/Resource
- Utilization of resources
	- Used resource/Available resource

#### Quality
- Conformity
	- With defined service/product description
	- Non conform items/Total # items
- Reliability
	- Probability that product satifsies its function after time T
	- Mean time to failure
	- mean time to repair
	- mean time between failures = MTTF + MTTR
- Customer satisfaction
	- Through interviews, questionaries

#### Service
- Response time, Lead time
	- Time to satisfy order
- Punctuality
	- Delay
	- Average delay
	- \# delayed orders

	- On time and within specifications
- Flexibility toward customer
	- \# modified orders / \# orders
