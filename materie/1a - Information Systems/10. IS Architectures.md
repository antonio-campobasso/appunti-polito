# IS Architectures
3 main options:
- Functions and islands (or silos)
	- Several buisness functions
	- Local IS are developed per buisness functions
	- Data is replicated
- One data base
	- One DB or replicas with automatic synchronization
	- One data model
	- Horizontal integrity of data
	- Vertical integrity
- Microservices
	- Modularity and encapsulation (OOP)
	- Each service can use a different technology
	- Each service can be developed and deployed by different teams
	- Each service can focus on a specific buisness need

## Integraton Technologies
- API
	- The interaction follows a defined protocol
- Database
	- Integrity of data may be lost
- RPA (Robotic Process Automation)
	- Capturing and using data from GUIs
	- Can be used on any application
	-
