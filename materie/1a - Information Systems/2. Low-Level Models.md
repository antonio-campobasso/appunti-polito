 # Low level models
In these models we define 5 *model dimensions*.

## Organization dimension
**Organizational unit (OU)** = part of organization doing the same work.

### Organization Chart
![[schemi/Information system_Mo 25_10 - 12_25.excalidraw.md]]

- *Node* = role.
- *Top down lines* = commands, controls.
- *Bottom up lines* = reports.

### Linear Responsability Chart (LRC)
The linear responsibility chart represent process and the organization
structure and external actor involved in it (also describing if it is client of
the service or it is the service provider).

## Data dimension
![[schemi/5. low level models_gi 07_10 - 11_10.excalidraw.md]]
**UML chart**
- *Class* = set of object, only data (name and attributes).
- *Link* = property that cannot be represented on one object only.
	- To handle *multiplicity* we define a minimum and a maximum at each end of the link.
		- If *no number* is indicated = exactly 1.
		- If *n* is indicated = exactly n.
		- If * \* * is indicated = zero or more.

### Generalization
** B -> A **
B *specializes* A means that objects described by B have the same properties of objects described by A.
A is a *generalization of B*.

### Association attributes
![[schemi/Information system_Mo 25_10 - 13_00.excalidraw.md]]
2 possible implementations:
- **Intermediate class** (only one value per link)
- **Association class** (more than one value per link)

### Inclusion
**B is part of A ** (diamond shape on A)
- *Composition (filled diamond)* = if A disappears, B also disappears.
- *Aggregation (hollow diamond)* = if A disappears, B remains.

### Best practice
**Consider as classes**
- Physical entities.
- Roles.
- Social/legal/organizational entries.
- Events.
- Time intervals.
- Geographical entities.
- Reports, summaries, paper documents.

**Don't**
- Use plural for classes.
- Use class as an attribute.
- Forget multiplicities.
- Forget roles/association classes when needed.
- Use attributes that represent many objects.
- Repeat the relationship between classes as an attribute.
- Avoid loops unless the information is different on different paths.

## Process dimension
![[schemi/6. process models_gi 14_10 - 12_25.excalidraw.md]]

**BPMN (Buisness Process Model Notation)**.
Has *functional*, *Organizational*, and *Data* dimension.

**XOR gateways** = the input can go to only one output and waits for the first input.
**AND gateways** = extends the input to all outputs and waits for all the input.
**OR gateways** = takes one or more outputs, and waits for all *active* inputs
